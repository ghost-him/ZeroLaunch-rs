## 📕 Brief Introduction

ZeroLaunch is an application launcher meticulously crafted for the Windows platform, **helping you instantly find and launch desired applications for the ultimate in efficiency and speed!**

> Currently, the existing program launchers on the market don't quite meet my needs, so I developed this software. I use it daily, so there's no need to worry about me abandoning it (at most, there might be no new updates (～￣▽￣)～).

## 🖥️ Software Interface

## ✨ Why choose ZeroLaunch-rs / What makes ZeroLaunch-rs unique?

### 🔒 Privacy First
Runs completely offline, no internet connection required. Your data always stays on your device. Adhering to a zero data collection policy, strictly following local processing to ensure your information security.

### ⚡ Efficient Smart Search
Thanks to the optimization of a unique search algorithm, the program boasts excellent spell correction capabilities based on triple matching technology (full name/Pinyin/initials). The program supports mixed Chinese and English queries, combined with a real-time dynamic sorting algorithm and multi-threaded concurrent processing technology, achieving millisecond-level response speeds even on lower-spec devices.

### 🌐 Lightweight and Pure
Focused solely on application search and launch functions, achieving highly specialized application search. Undisturbed by other complex features, ready to use out of the box – that's how pure it is.

## 🛠️ Developer Guide

> This Rust is quite good, unified package management is very convenient.

### Environment Requirements

*   Rust v1.89.0
*   Node.js v22.11.0
*   Bun v1.2.3

### Build Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ghost-him/ZeroLaunch-rs.git

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Development mode
bun run tauri dev

# Use xtask automation build tool for production builds
cd xtask

# Build installer, x64 version only
cargo run --bin xtask build-installer --arch x64

# Build all versions (installer + portable, all architectures)
cargo run --bin xtask build-all

# Clean build artifacts
cargo run --bin xtask clean
```

Build artifacts:
- Installer: `.msi` files in project root directory
- Portable: `.zip` files in project root directory
- For detailed instructions, see [xtask/README.md](xtask/README.md)

## 📦 Data Directory Structure

The program comes in two versions: **Installer Version** and **Portable Version**:

- **Installer Version**: Uses `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\ZeroLaunch-rs\` as the local data directory
- **Portable Version**: Uses the software's installation directory as the local data directory

### Local Data Directory Structure

The local data directory contains the following files:

```
Local Data Directory/                   # Installer Version: C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\ZeroLaunch-rs\
                                        # Portable Version: Software installation directory
├── logs/                               # Runtime logs
├── icons/                              # Program icon cache
└── ZeroLaunch_local_config.json        # Local configuration file, stores related data and remote directory path
```

### Remote Directory Structure

The remote directory is used to store detailed runtime configurations of the program. By default, it's the same as the local data directory. Remote storage enables data synchronization between two machines.

```
Remote Directory/                       # Default: same as local data directory
├── background.png                      # Custom background image
└── ZeroLaunch_remote_config.json       # Remote configuration file, stores program runtime configuration
```

## 📌 Known Limitations

### Short Word Search

⚠️ When input length is < 3 characters, search results may not be precise enough.

## 🌍 Language Support

ZeroLaunch-rs currently supports the following languages:

- 🇨🇳 Simplified Chinese (zh-Hans)
- 🇹🇼 Traditional Chinese (zh-Hant) - Translated by Gemini 2.5 Pro
- 🇺🇸 English (en) - Translated by Gemini 2.5 Pro

### Changing Language

You can change the application's display language through the following methods:

![Language Selection Demo](asset/select_language.png)

*Language selection interface demonstration: Simple and intuitive language switching experience*

1. **Through Settings Interface**:
   - Open ZeroLaunch-rs settings window (as shown in the image above)
   - Click on the 「常规设置」 option in the left navigation bar
   - Find the 「界面语言」 dropdown menu in the 「语言设置」 section
